  <section class="about" >
   
    <p><b>Founded in 1994 by Maneka Gandhi, People for Animals (PFA) has become a prominent voice for animal welfare in India. The organization has a network of over 26 hospitals and shelters across the country, offering medical care and sanctuary for abandoned, injured, and abused animals. PFA also works to educate the public about animal rights, influence animal welfare legislation, and prevent cruelty towards animals. Through campaigns, workshops, and rescue operations, PFA aims to create a society where animals are treated with respect, kindness, and compassion.
      PFA's dedicated teams conduct rescues of animals suffering from abuse, provide emergency medical aid, and facilitate the rehabilitation and adoption of animals into loving homes. They are also involved in wildlife rescue, rehabilitation, and conservation efforts. PFA's work spans various species, from companion animals to wildlife, reflecting a holistic approach to animal welfare in India.</b></p>
