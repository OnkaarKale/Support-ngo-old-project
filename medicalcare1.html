  <section class="about" >
   
    <p><b>Founded in 2002, Smile Foundation works across India to provide essential healthcare services to underserved populations. One of their flagship initiatives, the Smile on Wheels program, brings mobile healthcare services directly to the doorsteps of communities that lack access to basic medical facilities. These mobile units are equipped with doctors, paramedics, and necessary medical equipment to deliver free healthcare services, including general check-ups, maternal and child healthcare, and preventive treatments. <br>

        In addition to mobile healthcare, Smile Foundation organizes health camps and awareness sessions focused on issues like nutrition, sanitation, and disease prevention. Their holistic approach to healthcare also includes education and advocacy, working to create sustainable health improvements in the communities they serve. By combining healthcare delivery with education and awareness, Smile Foundation is committed to building healthier futures for Indiaâ€™s most vulnerable populations.</b></p>
