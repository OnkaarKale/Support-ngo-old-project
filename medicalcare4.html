    <p><b>The Akshaya Patra Foundation, initially focused on feeding children
        through its mid-day meal scheme, has extended its support to healthcare 
        for school children. Their healthcare initiatives include routine health
        check-ups, screenings for common ailments, and providing corrective treatment
         as needed. Akshaya Patra also educates children on personal hygiene, preventive 
         healthcare, and nutrition to support their overall well-being. Working in
          partnership with government agencies and private organizations, they ensure
           that children from low-income families receive essential healthcare and grow
            up healthy, aiding their educational journey.</b></p>
