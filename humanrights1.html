  <section class="about" >
   
    <p><b>Founded in the early 1990s, the Human Rights Law Network (HRLN) is one of India's most influential human rights organizations, operating as a collective of lawyers and activists who believe in upholding the rights of the disadvantaged and marginalized. HRLN provides pro bono legal support to individuals and communities facing human rights violations, working on cases related to women's rights, children’s rights, workers' rights, disability rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and more. They collaborate with various grassroots organizations, providing legal education, conducting investigations, and filing public interest litigations (PILs) in courts across India. <br>

        HRLN’s work extends beyond the courtroom, as they also engage in advocacy and training programs to empower communities with knowledge about their legal rights. By tackling systemic issues and advocating for legislative changes, HRLN strives to build a more just and equitable society for all.</b></p>
